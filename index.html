            <p>I am very new to the web development world, I had always wanted to get in to the topic when I was younger but was never able to for one reason or another.</p>
            
            <p>I Am in the process of trying to teach myself HTML as well as CSS so that I can make a switch
                in careers. I currently work in the IT field but have found that they are unrelated in almost every way.
            </p>
            
               <p>I spent 5 years in the United States Navy, all of it over seas. I was working physical security as well as Cybber
                   which is what I currently do at work. 
               </p>
            
                <p>When I do have spare time I spend it training local SWAT teams as weapons and special tactics.</p>
